                        <p> Dawn breaks over mist-shrouded groves, where skilled 
                            hands—much like the ancient nymphs of myth—pluck only the youngest leaves and 
                            buds. </p>
                            <p> We harvest by hand during the cool morning hours, ensuring each leaf captures 
                            the pure dew of the earth. </p>
                            <p> Sustainability is our oath; we never overpick, allowing 
                            the plants to regenerate in harmony with the seasons. </p>

                        <p> Freshly gathered leaves rest in shaded alcoves, where 
                        warm breezes coax out their moisture. </p>
                        <p> Over 12–24 hours, they soften and release their 
                        aromatic soul, transforming from vibrant green to a supple whisper. This step is poetry 
                        in motion—too quick, and the flavor fades; too slow, and bitterness creeps in. </p>
                        <p> We monitor with the intuition of generations. </p>

                <H3>Rolling</H3>
                    <p> Here, the leaves meet skilled artisans who roll them by 
                    hand on bamboo mats, mimicking the gentle waves of the Aegean. This breaks the cell walls, 
                    unlocking the enzymes that will define the tea's character—whether the bright vibrancy of 
                    our green varieties or the deeper, malty notes of our blacks. </p>
                    <p>No machines touch our leaves; only human touch infuses life. </p>

                <p>
                    Depending on the tea, we guide a controlled dance with 
                    oxygen. Our greens are steamed swiftly to preserve their emerald freshness, halting oxidation 
                    like a swift zephyr. Blacks linger longer, developing rich, coppery depths akin to a sunset over 
                    olive groves. Oolongs? A delicate balance, half-steeped in time. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each choice honors the leaf's inherent wisdom.

                    The final embrace of fire—low and even, in clay ovens fired by olive 
                    wood—seals the journey. Leaves crisp to perfection, their essence locked in forever.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We sort 
                    meticulously, discarding all but the finest, then package in breathable tins to safeguard the 
                    aroma until it reaches your hands.

                    From these steps emerges Fillo Tsagiou: not just tea, but a liquid poem. Brew it mindfully—water at 
                    80–90°C, steep for 3 minutes—and let the leaves unfurl their secrets. Join us in this ritual; after all,
                    every sip revives the gods' own elixir. Discover our blends here and taste the legacy.

                        At Fillo Tsagiou, delivery is the final verse in our leaf's epic, carrying whispers of Parnassus to your hearth 
                        with the reverence of an ancient rite. We cradle each tin like a sacred vessel, ensuring the essence travels 
                        untouched by haste or harm—sourced from the earth's quiet pulse, arriving not as mere parcels, but as invitations 
                        to ritual. Once dried and sorted, the leaves nestle into heirloom-inspired tins, hand-stamped with motifs of olive 
                        branches and ancient amphorae, sealed with beeswax from Attic hives to preserve their aroma as if guarded by the Muses 
                        themselves. Layered with recycled parchment that whispers "freshness eternal," each package includes a handwritten note 
                        sharing your blend's myth, a brewing rite, and a sprig of mountain thyme—no plastic veils, only earth's own guardians.

                    <p>
                        Our journey honors the cradle that bore the leaves: boxes of FSC-certified olive wood pulp, bound with jute twine from 
                        Aegean shores, offset every mile through reforestation on Parnassus slopes for carbon-neutral vows. Local souls in Greece 
                        receive their elixir via electric vans along coastal winds, while global kin partner with DHL GoGreen, planting a tree per 
                        order—trace the path on our site, a map etched with stars. From hillside ateliers, tins embark at dawn, timed to the moon's 
                        cycle for optimal freshness: EU arrivals in 2–3 days like a swift zephyr, oceans crossed in 5–7 days under cool-chain guard 
                        at 18°C and low humidity, monitored like watchful dryads. If delays dare (rare as winter olives), a complimentary sachet of 
                        serenity arrives. Your encrypted code whispers the way; at your threshold, the parcel awaits like a gift from the gods—discreet, 
                        unyielding to elements. Unwrap to reveal a portal: steam rising, stories unfolding. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Brew your first cup under the same sun that 
                        kissed the leaves, and feel the circle complete—if stars misalign, we remake and resend, no questions etched. From hillside to hand, 
                        Fillo Tsagiou delivers legacy in liquid form. Ready to summon your elixir? Order now and let the voyage begin.

            <p> 
                In the shadow of Mount Parnassus, where Apollo once strung his lyre and the Muses danced on dew-kissed stones, Fillo Tsagiou was born—not 
                from ambition, but from a quiet ache for the forgotten. It began in the olive-scarred hands of Eleni, a poet-herbalist whose veins ran with 
                the sap of ancient groves. Exiled from the clamor of Athens' marble streets, she returned to her village in the 1990s, chasing the echo of her grandmother's 
                tales: leaves that whispered secrets to the wind, brews that mended the soul's quiet fractures. "Tsagiou," her yiayia called the tender shoots—tea leaves, plucked 
                not for trade, but for communion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eleni's first harvest was rebellion wrapped in ritual. Amid Greece's economic tempests, she foraged wild mountain herbs, blending them with rare Camellia sinensis smuggled 
                from misty Asian kin, coaxing hybrids that tasted of thyme-laced sunrises and salted Aegean foam. No factories, no haste—only clay pots over olive-wood fires, where steam rose 
                like offerings to forgotten gods. Neighbors gathered, skeptical at first, then enchanted: a sip of "Nymph's Whisper" eased a lover's quarrel; "Oracle's Veil" sharpened a farmer's 
                dawn resolve. Word rippled like a libation poured, from hillside tavernas to the ferries of Hydra.
            </p>
            <p>
                By 2010, as the world teetered, Fillo Tsagiou took root—a humble atelier etched into Parnassus' flank, where Eleni's son, Theo, joined the rite. A botanist by trade, wanderer by 
                blood, he mapped the slopes' hidden veins, partnering with shepherds to cultivate sustainable groves that mimicked nature's wild poetry. Together, they wove myth into method: tins 
                etched with Delphi's serpents, blends named for Homer's sirens. Trials were tender—droughts that parched the earth, skeptics who dismissed "fancy weeds" for factory floods. Yet each 
                setback bloomed: a flooded harvest birthed our smoked oolong, kissed by resilient rain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, as the calendar turns to 2025, Fillo Tsagiou stands not as empire, but as echo—a chorus of 20 souls, hands callused by care, shipping elixirs to kindred spirits from Santorini 
                sands to Seattle rains. We've guarded our oath: no compromise on craft, every leaf a verse in an unfinished hymn. From Eleni's first fragile brew to the global groves we now tend, we've 
                journeyed not to conquer, but to remember. Here, in the cradle of inspiration, we invite you: sip, and become part of the song. What myth will your cup unfold?
